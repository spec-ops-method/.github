# SpecOps: Specification-Driven Legacy System Modernization

SpecOps is a methodology for using AI to modernize legacy government systems by focusing on knowledge preservation and verified specifications rather than direct code translation.

**Key Principle**: The specification is more valuable than the code. It captures institutional knowledge, enables domain expert verification, and outlasts any particular technical implementation.

## How It Works

1. AI analyzes legacy systems and generates specifications in plain language
2. Domain experts verify these specifications before any modern code is written
3. The specification becomes the source of truth that guides implementation
4. All future changes flow through the specification first

**Result**: Preserved institutional knowledge, reduced risk, and a sustainable foundation for modernization.
